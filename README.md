Description: This module challenge required a social network API to be built using Mongoose and Express. The challenge featured two separate models: a user and thought model. The user model features an associated "friends" model that referenced itself and the thought model featured a "reactions" subdocument. Routes were created that allows clients to find all, find one, delete one, update one, or change one of each of the two models, along with their associations. The routes interact with the models to edit the database's data.
